	3.6a-c (Skip the test in part c, but still answer the question about whether the normality assumption appears reasonable)
	
	3.11a,b  (Note: only the X variable and the residuals are provided in the data set)
	I am changing homework problem 3.11(b) to extra credit and will have more to say about it in class today.  I've you've done any work on it, you will get some credit.


	3.15
		In part (a), plot the data with the fitted regression line and report the estimated slope and intercept.  Fit the model to concentration vs. time, without transformation
	
	3.16
		In part (b), just use the boxcox function in R and report the plot obtained from that function.  You do not need to evaluate SSE at any specific values of lambda.  The boxcox function requires the MASS package
